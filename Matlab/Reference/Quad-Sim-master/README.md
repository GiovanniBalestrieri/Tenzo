Provided here is an assortment of materials designed to assist users in modeling and simulation of a quadcopter.
Specifically:

•Test rig designs for component performance measurement

•Several MATLAB data analysis tools and GUIs (R2013a Tested)

•A configurable Simulink quadcopter simulation

•And a bit more stuff…


The full package should be available for download at:

These materials are partially the result of a Senior Design project at Drexel University. The team consisted of:
D. Hartman, K. Landis, M. Mehrer, S. Moreno, and J. Kim.
Our faculty advisor was Dr. B. C. Chang

As this is our first attempt at a public release of our materials, there are undoubtedly errors, omissions, 
and downright lies contained herein. Expect frequent updates as we find and correct issues.

We do not claim to be experts. All of our materials are provided simply as a service to the 
multi-rotor community in sincere hope that it will prove useful as a basis for further inquiry. Users are 
expected to reference our materials against more reliable sources, and use their best judgment or 
consult professional advice where appropriate, particularly where safety may be a concern.

Quadcopters and RC vehicles are dangerous and are not toys. 
Use caution and follow all manufacturer safety instructions.

That said, we hope you find these materials helpful. Good luck!


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
===
We provide documentation and instructions related to quadcopter dynamic modeing and simulation for control design. 
A good starting point is to take a close look at what materials are provided within these documents, and see how it fits into your project needs.
In general, it would be advisable to add all of the MATLAB and Simulink related folders
to the MATLAB path so that they can be easily accessed within the MATLAB environment.
Once you understand what we provide, you can tackle the materials in any order, or split up tasks among a team. Generally speaking, the order of tasks should be fairly self evident, and to some degree flexible depending on the needs of your project and your available resources.
