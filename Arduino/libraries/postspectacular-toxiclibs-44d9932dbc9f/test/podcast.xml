			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With this another installment of <strong>Sound Bytes</strong>, I share with you my latest favorite selections in minimal-dub-tech-house and funky polished beats. First up is a brand new release from <b>Thoughtless</b> which should keep your heads bopping, rolling into the latest from <b>Echocord</b>, and when you&#8217;re all warmed up, confidently stepping into the darker territory of <b>M-nus</b> output. By now it&#8217;s no secret that I enjoy the mind cleansing minimal beat &#8211; I have always been hypnotized by the kick-click-tick-tocks. I hope you enjoy this mini itinerary for your upcoming trip.</p>
<div class="itemhead" style="margin-top:60px!important;font-weight:bold!important;">Limaçon &#8211; Tarry Not (Thoughtless)</div>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4305" title="Tarry Not" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/tarry-not.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Deriving from the Latin <em>limax</em> (&#8220;snail&#8221;), a limaçon is a geometric circular pattern, similar to that of a <em>cardioid</em>. Santa Cruz based Christopher Lee, adopted the name <a href="http://www.limaconmusic.com"><strong>Limaçon</strong></a> in 1997, to create a solid, minimal, and driving sound of tech-house, that cleans out the crevices of my mind, previously occupied by all noisy thought. Yes, this extremely hypnotic, four-to-the-floor beat, is relaxing for me. Once your focus latches onto the repetitive patterns, it leaves no room for worries, anxieties or concerns. There is just this sound, rolling forward with the clean, polished, granular synthetic sounds. In his bio, Lee talks about his production : &#8220;<em>I try to keep a balance between something for your mind and something for your body, between experimenting with new sounds and giving people something they can grab onto.</em>&#8221; With a few digital releases and 12-inchers behind his belt, <em>Tarry Not</em> is Lee&#8217;s debut album, on Canadian digital label, <a href="http://thoughtlessmusic.com/"><strong>Thoughtless Music</strong></a>. The latter, by the way, is part of the extended <strong>Native State </strong>family, with a few excellent releases by <strong>Noah Pred</strong>, <strong>Evan Marc</strong> and <strong>KiloWatts. </strong>Recommended for the minimalists and followers of <strong>Steve Bug</strong>, <strong>Claro Intelecto</strong>, and <strong>Surgeon</strong>. Be sure to pick up your digital copy directly from <a href="https://www.beatport.com/en-US/html/content/release/detail/210189/tarry_not"><strong>Beatport</strong></a> [preferred], also available on Bleep, Juno, and of course, iTunes.<br />

<div class="itemhead" style="margin-top:60px!important;font-weight:bold!important;">Luke Hess &#8211; Light In The Dark (Echocord)</div>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4834" title="Light In The Dark" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/light-in-the-dark.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Following a half a dozen of 12&#8243; EPs, Detroit raised <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hesslabs"><strong>Luke Hess</strong></a> lands his debut full length on <a href="http://www.echocord.com/"><strong>Echocord</strong></a>. The Copenhagen based label is famous for its minimal, deep, and dubby output with releases from <strong>Rod Modell</strong> (aka <strong>Deepchord</strong>), <strong>Quantec</strong>, and <strong>Mikkel Metal</strong> among the many. Embedded deeply in the names of the nine tracks, and the title of the album itself, <em>Light In The Dark</em>, Hess projects a few spiritual connotations behind his music and the central theme. If the search for enlightenment is not your cup of tea, then perhaps the sound of light rolling tech-house beat, deep bass, and echoed minor chords will show you the way. Full of Detroit minimalist elements, the album trots on through lush textures and spacious atmospheres, measured by a tight and punchy kick. <em>Light In The Dark</em> is a steady, meditative, cleansing, and an eye/ear opening experience. Great for the headphones and dance-floors alike. Be sure to also check out <em>Ignite The Dark Remixes </em>EP with reworks from <strong>cv313</strong>, <strong>Marko Fürstenberg</strong> and <strong>Mikkel Metal</strong>.<br />

<div class="itemhead" style="margin-top:60px!important;font-weight:bold!important;">Hobo &#8211; Trackz (M-nus)</div>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4315" title="Trackz" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/trackz.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Since I&#8217;m in a minimal kind of mood, it only makes sense that I turn next to <strong>Richie Hawtin</strong>&#8217;s<strong> </strong>Canadian label, <a href="http://www.m-nus.com"><strong>M_nus</strong></a>. By the way, Hawtin has recently announced the return of <a href="http://www.plastikman.com/"><strong>Plastikman</strong></a> with a new album in the pipeline. One can only hope that it will live up to our expectations. But back to <a href="http://www.hobotracks.com/"><strong>Hobo</strong></a>, whose real name is Joel Boychuk. Along with Adam Young, Boychuk has already released as <strong>Tactile</strong>, see <em>Silent Movie </em>(M_nus, 2007). For his solo project, Boychuk collects four tracks on a 12&#8243; (and eight on a digital release), showcasing extremely clean and minimal techno, with polished production skills and an ear tuned to perfection. Look, this is mind cleansing, shamelessly stripped, pounding techno, and I&#8217;m not at all embarrassed to be in love with it. Boychuk&#8217;s bio on the label&#8217;s page begins with &#8220;<em>Sometimes you have to lose yourself in order to find a better way. It’s  not a conscious decision, it can’t be forced – it’s just the way of the  wanderer…&#8221; </em>And that is precisely how I feel when listening to this music. Recommended for the likes of <strong>Geiser</strong>, <strong>JPLS</strong>, <strong>Heartthrob</strong>, <strong>Ben Klock</strong> and <strong>Redshape</strong>.<br />

<p><em>Interview with Richard Chartier</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hey Richard, thank you for joining us. What did you do this past weekend?</strong></em><br />
this past weekend i bought a huge mid century executive desk designed by Jens Risom for my studio/office. and my partner Robert and i went to see the new ColorForms exhibit and Joseph Albers Retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. We also celebrated the great news that i had been awarded the Smithsonian Institution Artist Research Fellowship to explore/record the Museum of Natural History’s collection of 19th Century acoustic apparatus for scientific demonstration.</p>
<p><em><strong>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. How did you first get into music?</strong></em><br />
one of the first records i remember playing (which belonged to my parents) was Kraftwerk&#8217;s Autobahn. i am not sure how it got there as it was so different from al the other records they owned.</p>
<p><em><strong>What about the first time when you started producing? What did you use?</strong></em><br />
i think my first synthesizer was a Yamaha DX100 this was probably in 1985? i did not formally start making &#8220;serious&#8221; electronic music until 1989</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you remember your very first release? What did it feel like, holding your own music in your hands?</strong></em><br />
My first formal release was the CD &#8220;Direct.Incidental.Consequential&#8221; on Howard Stelzer&#8217;s Intransitive Records. I was doing the package, identity design for Howard and ended up sending him some sound works i had been working on in 1998, as well as early stuff from 1990-92. It was a wonderful feeling to have that first cd come out. I never thought i would release it, and to be honest i wasnt sure if i would release anything else.</p>
<p><em><strong>In 1999 you released an album with Taylor Deupree, titled SPEC. How did you meet Taylor?</strong></em><br />
I contacted several artists whose work i had been enjoying or had influenced me. Among some of the artists I sent the intransitive CD to: Taylor Deupree, Steve Roden, Chris and Cosey, CoH, Matmos. All of whom i became friends with. I began talking with Taylor Deupree on a regular basis and ended up meeting with him at his home and studio when i was in NY one weekend. We shared a lot of common interests and goals, especially when it came to music, aesthetics, architecture. oh and, he had never met anyone else who loved the band Pink Industry.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tell us about your first sound installation. How did that come about?</strong></em><br />
my first sound installation was a project for a multi-disciplinary art class at my university. i had found a strange storage area in one of the old buildings where the painting classes were held. in was a corridor in the basement that was probably 40 feet long and about 8 feet wide. it was originally the entrance to a bomb shelter. this long hallway was very very dark, pitch black about 20 feet in and ended at a T. There were two space on either side which were the sealed off stairwells to the bomb shelter. In each of these alcoves i had a long drone piece eminatting from an amplified CD. the sound would the back wall and project backwards into the hallway. the 2 pieces were inverted so they created an out of phase . Along with the pitch black darkness the effect of the distant audio being out of phase it was very disorienting. unfortunately it could not be shown again due to potential lawsuits etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where do you think the line dissolves between creating albums and sound art?</strong></em><br />
musicality? an &#8220;album&#8221; is merely a form that sound art can take.</p>
<p><em><strong>And when you create music today, do you produce an album to be listened to at home, or are you creating sound art intended to be showcased at an exhibit, that may eventually be documented by a release on your label?</strong></em><br />
each project is very distinct. installation work on multiple speakers or dealing with loop cycles can&#8217;t truly be replicated/reduced onto a CD. the installation work is very much about the body within a space.</p>
<p><strong><em>You&#8217;ve collaborated with many artists, including the above mentioned Taylor Deupree, William Basinski, and COH. What was your most memorable partnership?</em></strong><br />
They are all very unique and different experiences, because each of the artists i have worked with are very distinct. i have always believed that the best collaborations are those where the listener cannot hear each artist distinctly. I find that working collaboratively i tend to take on (or perhaps learn from) certain characteristics of the other artist in the project. I really enjoy working with Asmus Tietchens. I have a very great respect for him and his long history of works and he is an incredibly kind man. We met at the Observatori Festival in Valencia, Spain in 2003. During one of our conversations he said that listening to Ryoji Ikeda, I, and (if i remember correctly) Steve Roden had really inspired him to create new work such as the Mengen series. That was a profound moment for me, having someone as iconic and brilliant as Asmus say that i had in any way influenced him.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there anyone that you would love to work with in the future?</strong></em><br />
I would love to do something with AGF (but i haven&#8217;t asked her yet&#8230; maybe i will now). I love what she does sonically with lyrics and vocals. I have approached creating something with Robert Curgenven, because i love the nature of his process and sound. My friend Kid Congo Powers (guitarist extra-ordinaire from The Cramps, Gun Club, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) are trying to figure out how to begin our collaboration. (he is on tour a lot) I look forward to that one as i think it will be VERY strange combination.</p>
<p><em><strong>At which point did you decide that you wanted to have your own label?</strong></em><br />
Well, it all came about because of my work &#8220;series.&#8221; I had sent it off to Ritornell/Mille Plateaux and Raster-Noton. Eckhard Ehlers and Olaf Bender both responded that while they liked it, it was just too minimal (which i thought was funny). As i thought more and more and discussed the recording with Taylor Deupree (and after us both deciding it was too minimal for 12k as well), he suggested &#8220;why not just start a new label, or sub label of 12k?&#8221; and so i did, i already had some demos from other artists who i was interested in having on 12k that were also in that same vein. LINE was born. right after we had made all the plans and finalized the logo etc etc, Olaf Bender of Raster-Noton wrote me and said he had finally listened to it on a very high quality studio and finally &#8216;got it&#8217; and wanted to release it. ooops too late.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where did the name LINE come from?</strong></em><br />
a line is just the shortest distance between two points. it was a very fitting name for the type of work that LINE would release.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tell us the intended vision behind your label, when you first created it. Has that purpose changed throughout the years?</strong></em><br />
the original mission was to document digital minimalist sound art and installations. this has evolved over the past decade to include audio/video works on DVD, and some not so minimal works, like Mark Fell&#8217;s first LINE CD and Chessmachine. Also acoustic works have come into the mix with Doublends Vert and Janek Schaefer&#8217;s releases.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe the relationship between 12k and LINE?</strong><br />
siblings? Taylor Deupree is 12k and i am LINE. Although we have always bounced off each other ideas regarding cover designs, artists, projects etc about both labels. Taylor is also the businessman. I am the &#8220;artistic director&#8221; of LINE. I convinced Taylor way back to create a uniform template for the releases. I think his designs and his photography for 12k have made each release beautiful and special.</p>
<p><em><strong>And what is 3particles?</strong></em><br />
well i didn&#8217;t buy richardchartier.com and by the time i had actually made a name for myself it was taken by a Canadian real estate agent. electrons, muons, and tau are the 3 primary particles that make up an atom. it was a name of a piece i did and it just stuck.</p>
<p><em><strong>You&#8217;ve got an amazing catalog of releases on LINE, including works by Alva Noto, Bernhard Gunter, Steve Roden, Christopher Willits et al. Are there any ones that you are especially proud of?</strong></em><br />
Bernhard Gunters 4CD &#8220;monochrome&#8221; series, the works by Asmus Tietchens, Mark Fell&#8217;s &#8220;Ten types of Elsewhere&#8221; stand out just off the top of my head. All the LINE releases are very distinct to me, each with its own special qualities. I love Robert Curgenven&#8217;s &#8220;Oltre&#8221; , i have been listening to it on repeat.</p>
<p><em><strong>And is there anyone in particular that you would be honored to sign?</strong></em><br />
hmmmmm off the top of my head i can only think of Chris Watson.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you decide on which artists and albums get released on your label?</strong></em><br />
its very subjective.</p>
<p><em><strong>What advice would you give to artists interested in getting their own record deal?</strong></em><br />
be confident, present your work well. don&#8217;t send messy demos. and don&#8217;t bombard labels with excessive emails and packages. and most especially DON&#8217;T contact them through myspace.</p>
<p><em><strong>In 2008 LINE had five album releases. In 2009, four. And it looks like for this year you have already scheduled four albums. Can you talk a little about the economics of running a label?<br />
</strong></em>I am not involved deeply in the day to day economics of the label. both 12k and LINE are labors of love for Taylor and myself.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are some of the most difficult aspects of running your own label?</strong></em><br />
for me, its balancing work on the label with my own work and projects. its a lot of shifting gears.</p>
<p><em><strong>And what are the rewarding ones?</strong></em><br />
i was just rearranging my studio/office recently and laid out all of the LINE releases on the floor. it was quite impressive. i have now put a whole decade of my life into LINE. so the most rewarding part is the final product and having been a meaningful part in having these artists and these works heard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any advice for someone who wants to kick off their own label?</strong></em><br />
start honest and professional and stay honest and professional</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s next for LINE?</strong></em><br />
the upcoming new releases are by Lovesliescrushing, Alva Noto, Yann Novak&#8230;&#8230; more surprises to come&#8230;.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thank you for your time. Any last words for the readers of Headphone Commute?</strong></em><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s something special about having a recorder [or a camera] around you all the time. Certain opportunities just present themselves, like Kodak moments, to be captured and preserved. This is a story about one of them&#8230;</p>
<p>I was walking on the street when I stopped to pet a beautiful dog &#8211; a Corgi. I think I was more interested in the dog, until the old man walking him started talking to me. I don&#8217;t remember how the conversation started, until he said something like &#8220;<em>never do today what you can leave till tomorrow&#8230;</em>&#8220;, which is the complete opposite of what I thought that the actual saying should be. And then he added, &#8220;<em>&#8230; that&#8217;s what they say in Spain.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>And like many people at his age, something triggered a memory, and he started telling me about how he was stationed in Madrid, during his service in the Army, and how he was part of the team, building the gas pipelines from Barcelona. That turned to the cost of living &#8220;<em>at that time</em>&#8220;, and by the time Americans were finished with the project, &#8220;<em>&#8230; they got expensive as hell</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Only at that moment did I think of quietly slipping my hand into the pocket and hitting the record button, while inconspicuously holding the recorder around my waste line. I really like his voice and his accent as well &#8211; I think he&#8217;s from the South (Texas?). Below this recording is my attempted transcription thereof, in case you&#8217;re having difficulties understanding&#8230;</p>
<p><span style='text-align:left;display:block;'><p><object type='application/x-shockwave-flash' data='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' width='500' height='24' id='audioplayer1'><param name='movie' value='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' /><param name='FlashVars' value='&amp;bg=0xf8f8f8&amp;leftbg=0xeeeeee&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xcccccc&amp;rightbghover=0x999999&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0x9FFFB8&amp;titles=008%20-%20Tue%20%20April%2006%202010&amp;width=500&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fheadphonecommute.com%2Fpostcards%2F008.mp3' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='menu' value='false' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /></object></p></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;&#8230; They got expensive as hell. Price, when I was there,  a thousand peseta note&#8230; was like&#8230; eh&#8230; to them was like a thousand dollar bill. You can feed a family of four on fifty cents a day. And feed them good! Twenty five pesetas would buy everything they need for that&#8230; that&#8217;s what they used to do, is shop, you know, every day. The maids would go on and buy the groceries at the market. Yeah, but I&#8230; I understand. They dug up all those old Roman roads and made super highways&#8230; [a car goes by right at that moment] They really ruined a beautiful country, is what they did&#8230;&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>They really ruined a beautiful country&#8230;</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4787" title="The Breeze Blowing Over Us" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/the-breeze-blowing-over-us.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Infrequency Editions</strong> is a sub-label of <strong>Dragon&#8217;s Eye</strong>, the latter owned and operated by <strong>Yann Novak</strong> himself. The label was originally founded by Jamie Drouin and Lance Olsen, but after a brief hiatus, and introduction to Novak, it merged with Dragon&#8217;s Eye. Originally concerned with documenting live performances and sound installations presented through public concerts at a local gallery in Victoria (British Columbia), Infrequency also releases ambient and minimal studio compositions, as is the case with this recording. <em>The Breeze Blowing Over Us </em>is based on a simple recording of a fan, during one of the hottest days in Seattle. This recording is transformed into a 38+ minute composition that layers organic and synthetic sounds into a thick, brooding, drenched with tropical haze, and tense composition, with a slow movement of mechanically distributed air, worthy of its original title.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:left;display:block;'><p><object type='application/x-shockwave-flash' data='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' width='500' height='24' id='audioplayer1'><param name='movie' value='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' /><param name='FlashVars' value='&amp;bg=0xf8f8f8&amp;leftbg=0xeeeeee&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xcccccc&amp;rightbghover=0x999999&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0x9FFFB8&amp;titles=The%20Breeze%20Blowing%20Over%20Us%20%28Sample%29&amp;artists=Yann%20Novak&amp;width=500&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fheadphonecommute.com%2Ftracks%2F2010%2Fthebreeze.mp3' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='menu' value='false' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /></object></p></span></p>
<p>The piece begins with a moving onslaught of dense textures, inching its way into the foreground at a crawling pace. Muffled sound waves, resembling a pitched down ocean, or the rumbling of a gigantic vehicle passing through an underground tunnel, are offset by distant, high frequency robotic screeches of an alien species. I proceed with caution in the darkness, and feel ahead what must be the door handle. I guess this is where I enter. Suddenly, I&#8217;m fighting through the thick vegetation of sound. Soon I come out upon an opening, where the chords crawl up a mountain in a melting drone of lava. This expedition with sound enters a sacred circle of open mouths and stretched out hands, to lift the trapped spirit into the cloud of white noise, only to be spilled again in a form of frequency rain, at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of this recording is tightly wound, condensed, drenched in suspenseful emotions, with a slight tingling of uneasiness. Some may even find this unsettling &#8211; but not I. I love dark and spooky. Descending deep into abandoned caverns of sound is my part time sport. For the same reasons that one replays those eerie horror movies, I return to Novak&#8217;s world, time and time again. Check out Novak&#8217;s extensive discography, with many limited and archival recordings of live performances on Dragon&#8217;s Eye. His attention to detail with the work on a label, and persistence at reinventing his sound has finally been rewarded &#8211; Novak has been noticed by <strong>Richard Chartier </strong>and is scheduled to release an album on <strong>Line</strong> in September of 2010.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Breeze Blowing Over was recorded during one of the hottest days in Seattle. Tell us about that day.</strong></em><br />
Well that day is kind of a blur, the piece ended up being about that weekend and what led up to it.  That day was the hottest day that summer, that summer became my last summer living in Seattle and it was the first weekend I spent with my Partner.  The story that led to that weekend&#8217;s importance started when I saw my partner for the first time in Montreal when I was there to perform at Mutek.  He was attending the festival and being the shy person that I am, I was fixated on him through the festival, but never got up the nerve to talk to him.  I repeated my modus operandi later that year at the Decibel Festival in Seattle, again seeing and never interacting.  We finally met in San Francisco at a performance he has organized which sparked  a long distance dialog which would inevitably lead to this weekend in Seattle when we would spend some time together for the first time and inevitably be one of the catalysts for my relocation to Los Angeles.</p>
<p><em><strong>So you sampled the sound of the fan, and then what?</strong></em><br />
With all my work I am interested in starting from a simple, often autobiographical point and intend to transform it into an experience for the audience that conveys my emotional state at the time the source was conceived. So I started with a 45 minute recording of my boxfan in the window, and altered it in every way imaginable, making variation after variation.  Then when the recording could not bend anymore, I start to listen to all this material and see what sounds will become pieces that will help in accurately portraying this emotional state.  Then the actual composition is built from improvisations with these sound in my studio, fitting things together until it sounds like an accurate portrait of how this experience felt to me.</p>
<p><em><strong>What would you say were the aspects of that particular environment that had the overall effects on the atmosphere of the album?</strong></em><br />
The album was about more then just that day as I said earlier, so though there are moments in the piece about that blissful afternoon on that hot day.  There were also allot of darker uncertain moments represented that led up to that weekend.  In a more literal sense allot of sounds from that environment made it into the piece.  The original recording was quiet rich with sounds since I lived in a very busy part of Seattle.  I was by the Puget Sound so there are allot of seagulls filtered through the whirling blades of the fan, people talking and communing, bussed coming screeching to a halt and there motors rumbling as they started again.  But of course the fan was the most significant because Seattle has a very short summer, so using a fan is not the norm there, and 90+ days are even rarer, so that fan cranked on hi what quiet an anomaly.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are some of the production techniques that you use to achieve the desired density of sound?</strong></em><br />
I have no idea.  In my own practice I am really concerned with the conceptual content and the emotional content that is conveyed to the audience in my work.  I have always believed that getting to far into the technical side of working with the computer will distract me from my goals.  So I have made a conscious effort not to learn what I am doing.  I use a DAW and I have a million effects that process the sound, but what those effects do it a mystery to me, and I never save any of the processing chains after I am done.  I really want to be unencumbered by the technical stuff and just concentrate on the concept and how the sounds make me feel or will make the audience feel. Because when those two things are in harmony, I know I am going in the right direction.</p>
<p><em><strong>How did you decide on releasing this album on Infrequency vs. Dragon&#8217;s Eye?</strong></em><br />
I started Dragon&#8217;s Eye to release my own work and to build a community of artists around me that were at the same point in there careers, but at some point I felt like that goal had been achieved and Dragon&#8217;s Eye had actually gotten bigger and more popular then I had ever imagined.  I had also imagined Dragon&#8217;s Eye as a launching pad, where artists could release a record or two and then move on to bigger and better things.  So I felt I had to adhere to that goal as well, so I started to look outside Dragon&#8217;s Eye for publishing possibilities.  At that point Dragon&#8217;s Eye and Infrequency were completely separate entities, so I proposed the piece to Jamie Drouin who runs and curates the label and it went from there.</p>
<p>I also felt that since Dragon&#8217;s Eye had gotten bigger and more popular then I had ever imagined, that I had a responsibility to the community that supported it to share that success with as many emerging and mid-career artist as I could.  The label operated with very modest means, so every record of my own I release is a record by a talented artist out there that I can&#8217;t release.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tell us about your upcoming release on Line.</strong></em><br />
My Line release is a piece called Relocation.Reconstruction.  Its a continuation of the concepts portrayed in my Relocation exhibition in Seattle last year.  The exhibition was about my move from Seattle to Los Angeles and consisted of three installation: Relocation.Vacant (about leaving Seattle), Relocation.Mobile (about the drive down I-5 between the two cities) and Relocation.Dislocation (about the experience of arriving in Los Angeles.)  These Installation were about these specific experiences and how I felt in the moment.  Relocation.Reconstruction is about the journey after I got to Los Angeles and realized the process was far from over.  Its about a more internal transformation, that takes much longer then those physical events of moving and is happening no matter where you are.  Instead of making new recordings I used the sound from the previous three installations as a starting point to illustrate that this new work is part of that process, but the time spent living here and reflecting on the experience had changed how I though and felt about the move, each city, and who I am as an artist.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend I went to visit my friend&#8217;s elderly parents at the assisted living facility. In the reception, there was this old jukebox. I got drawn towards it mostly because of its bass. It was deep, tight, and resonated throughout the foyer. No modifications were made to this recording &#8211; I preserved the EQs as captured.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:left;display:block;'><p><object type='application/x-shockwave-flash' data='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' width='500' height='24' id='audioplayer1'><param name='movie' value='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' /><param name='FlashVars' value='&amp;bg=0xf8f8f8&amp;leftbg=0xeeeeee&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xcccccc&amp;rightbghover=0x999999&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0x9FFFB8&amp;titles=007%20-%20Tue%20April%2006%202010&amp;width=500&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fheadphonecommute.com%2Fpostcards%2F007.mp3' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='menu' value='false' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /></object></p></span></p>
<p>In the background you can hear the reception phones, some coughing, some weird slapping [playing cards?], and general people chatter as they shuffle back and forth with their walkers and silent wheel chairs. Some people take pictures. I take sounds. I think this is yet another great example of a captured moment that I&#8217;ll be able to recall in the future with a press of a button.</p>
<p>&#8212;-[edit 1]&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Being an absolute obsessive compulsive that I am, I dug up the actual name of the track, by listening to the lyrics.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>You&#8217;d Be So Nice to Come Home To</strong></em><strong><br />
</strong>[...]<br />
Under the stars, chilled by the winter<br />
Under an August moon, burning above<br />
You&#8217;d be so nice, you&#8217;d be paradise<br />
To come home to and love</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;-[edit 2]&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Did I mention that I am obsessive compulsive? Well, I actually dug  around some more and found the original track. It&#8217;s a recording from 1954, performed by <strong>Helen  Merrill</strong> with Clifford Brown. Here it is below, in its  entirety for your enjoyment.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been a regular contributor to <a href="http://themusiclobby.com/"><strong>The Music Lobby</strong></a> since the site&#8217;s inception back in 2007. I first met Casey Winters on last.fm and was captivated and inspired by his taste in music. And you know that feeling. Instantly you want to pick up and listen to every recommendation, and when each keeps on being better than the last, you become connected with music. Headphone Commute reviews have been syndicated on TML, and it&#8217;s about time that I brought you a taste of Onecaseman&#8217;s flavor. I cherry picked the below three entries from Casey&#8217;s latest reviews, to bring you the latest in hip-hop meets jazz meets electronica meets folk sound. All three are definitely my favorite albums, and I hope that with the embedded tracks you&#8217;d be inspired to pick them up as well&#8230; Enjoy these Sound Bytes!</p>
<div class="itemhead" style="margin-top:60px!important;font-weight:bold!important;">Bonobo &#8211; Black Sands (Ninja Tune)</div>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4731" title="Black Sands" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/black-sands.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Simon Green returns with his fourth album as <a href="http://www.bonobomusic.com/"><strong>Bonobo</strong></a>, and it&#8217;s more incredibly solid, future jazz material. With <em>Days To Come </em>(<a href="http://www.ninjatune.net"><strong>Ninja Tune</strong></a>, 2006), Green was bit by the vocal bug, and the vocals were the showpiece of that album. With <em>Black Sands</em>, he still has some vocals, but not as many, and they&#8217;re more reeled in to be in balance with the beats (he&#8217;s also using <strong>Andreya Triana</strong> as his muse, instead of <strong>Bajka</strong>). Speaking of the beats, you can tell Simon&#8217;s been listening to some of the wonky instrumental hip-hop that&#8217;s been coming out, as things get more hyper-active than ever on tracks like <em>&#8220;Kiara&#8221;</em>, which feature chiptunes and cut-up vocal samples playing off each other. But this is not a wonky album. Green layers these sounds with Eastern influences and the ever-present jazz sounds to make this a work firmly entrenched in his style, just amplified a bit by current events in hip-hop. The basslines on this album are some of Bonobo&#8217;s best. &#8220;<em>Kong</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>The Keeper</em>&#8221; rival anything on <em>Animal Magic</em> (<strong>Tru Thoughts</strong>, 2000). A good mix of old and new from Bonobo, and another wonderful album.</p>

<div class="itemhead" style="margin-top:60px!important;font-weight:bold!important;">Bibio &#8211; The Apple And The Tooth (Warp)</div>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4732" title="The Apple And The Tooth" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/the-apple-and-the-tooth.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></strong>Stephen Wilkinson, aka <a href="http://warp.net/records/bibio"><strong>Bibio</strong></a>, continues to churn out quality, in what has become his breakout year. Two albums and now two EP&#8217;s &#8211; this one with 4 new tracks and 8 remixes, it&#8217;s basically another full length. The new tracks start the show, and are fantastic. The title track perfects the folk-hop template while maintaining an energy most releases in this style can&#8217;t compete with. It bleeds directly into <em>&#8220;Rotten Rudd&#8221;</em>, which slows things down before becoming an anthemic sing-a-long. <em>&#8220;Steal The Lamp&#8221;</em> retreats from a <strong>Jaga Jazzist</strong> style opening into a <strong>Squarepusher</strong> style d&#8217;n'b freakout at the end, showing that Bibio still has more sounds he&#8217;s willing to tackle. On the remixes side, highlights are <strong>Lone</strong>&#8217;s effort, which throws the original sounds into a blender to create a smoothed out hip-hop groove. <strong>Leatherette</strong>&#8217;s cut-up, pitchshifted version of <em>&#8220;Lover&#8217;s Carvings&#8221;</em> takes some getting used to, but its lounge feel is too cool to be denied. Another highlight is Bibio&#8217;s own rework of <em>&#8220;Palm Of Your Wave&#8221;</em>, which takes the original tune to new heights. Another excellent release.

<div class="itemhead" style="margin-top:60px!important;font-weight:bold!important;">Kelpe &#8211; Cambio Wechsel (DC)</div>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4733" title="Cambio Wechsel" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/cambio-wechsel.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Kel McKeown returns with his third album after <em>Ex-Aquarium</em> (DC, 2008). I first became aware of <a href="http://www.kelpe.co.uk/"><strong>Kelpe</strong></a> with his debut album <em>Sea Inside Body</em> (DC, 2004). His aquatic themes and pure electronic sound were very captivating. When he returned four years later with <em>Ex-Aquarium</em>, the aquatic obsession was still there, but an influence by actual instruments totally transformed his sound (in a good way) in that it almost sounded like two different artists. <em>Cambio Wechsel</em> seems to have merged the sounds of those two albums. He also pulls some retro funk samples into the mix in a very compelling way. It seems to blend perfectly into his sound&#8217;s aesthetic. Squelchy bass is the backbone of <em>Cambio Wechsel</em>, which gives the album a much more hip-hop vibe than <em>Ex-Aquarium</em> (which came across as more folktronic to me) but Kel takes it away from the normal dirty hip-hop setting as much as is possible, converging it with the aforementioned funk, as well as folk, jazz, psychedelia, and kraut-rock. The overall effect is funky without being clubby. It&#8217;s a totally new sound, and that&#8217;s what Kelpe has been missing before, its own sound. With <em>Sea Inside Body</em>, it sounded like a lot of other IDM at the time. With <em>Ex-Aquarium</em>, it sounded like Four Tet. With <em>Cambio Wechsel</em>, it sounds like Kelpe.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was walking outside, and I heard these church bells ringing&#8230; It was then, that I actually realized that it was Easter Sunday. The bells were going on for almost an hour, so I couldn&#8217;t help but capture them. In this sound postcard, I am standing next to the First Presbyterian Church, the ringing of the bells reverberates off of the stone walls, and you can hear people shuffling in, all dressed up, for the Easter service at noon. </p>

<p>Sounds like someone is actually playing the bells, right? It&#8217;s not mechanical, because I hear a few hesitations. And what is this piece? Bach?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4698" title="Overcast Sound" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/overcast-sound.jpg?w=500&#038;h=250" alt="" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p>Canadian deep-techno duo, Michael Pettit and Jamie Drouin, producing under the moniker <strong>Overcast Sound</strong>, create &#8220;<em>introspective compositions built from fragments of field recordings, oblique references to dub rhythms, and sweeping cinematic textures</em>&#8230;&#8221; They have recently released a 3-track EP, <em>Untitled 12</em> on <strong>Untitled &amp; After</strong> label, which is highly recommended for fans of <strong>DeepChord</strong>, <strong>Quantec, bvdub</strong>, and anything on <strong>echospace [detroit]</strong> label. Mmm&#8230; did I get your taste buds wet? Then you will enjoy this showcase!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The OVERCAST SOUND project walks the line between ambient and deep techno, which is indicative of our individual influences: mine being on the dub/minimal side, and Jamie&#8217;s being the ambient/noise and experimental. This mix was made in our temporary studio in Berlin, where we are spending a few months working on several new tracks and getting to know other artists. It seemed fitting to start the mix with a track from Berlin&#8217;s Robert Henke before moving into the sweeping track Kommôs, taken from our new release on Untitled &amp; After, which shares a similar wall-of-texture foundation. This mix also features our friend Organon, who did a fabulous remix on our Untitled &amp; After EP. </em><em>The April Ambient Mix is like the current slow thawing of winter here  in Berlin, as the signs of Spring start appearing across the city.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As a special offer to Headphone Commute readers, Overcast Sound offers an exclusive remix of Kommôs as a <a href="http://overcastsound.bandcamp.com/track/komm-s-overcast-sound-drifting-mix"><strong>Free Download</strong></a>. Their latest UNTITLED 12 EP is available from <a href="https://www.beatport.com/en-US/html/content/release/detail/227314/untitled_12"><strong>Beatport</strong></a> starting March 23, and everywhere else on April 20.</p>

<p>[edit]</p>
<p>OK, looks like you guys gave up on this one. I did have one correct guess submitted via Facebook, so the winner there is <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/vivekjena"><strong>Vivek Jena</strong></a> who proudly displays his photo with Benn Jordan as the last.fm avatar [hehe!]. The correct answer is Automatic Car Wash!!!</p>
<p>The recorder was placed in cup holder, so that its body made contact with the entire car to pick up all of the bass rumbles. Ah, yes, now you can hear those loose large fabric pieces waving and slapping against the windshield, followed by repetitive high-pressure spraying from the nozzles, and then some more cleaning and brushing &#8211; this last part does indeed sound like the train wheels&#8230; Anyway, hope you enjoyed&#8230; I definitely like this one a lot!</p>

<p><span style='text-align:left;display:block;'><p><object type='application/x-shockwave-flash' data='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' width='500' height='24' id='audioplayer1'><param name='movie' value='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' /><param name='FlashVars' value='&amp;bg=0xf8f8f8&amp;leftbg=0xeeeeee&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xcccccc&amp;rightbghover=0x999999&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0x9FFFB8&amp;titles=Garment%20%28For%20A%20Garment%29&amp;artists=Alva%20Noto&amp;width=500&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fheadphonecommute.com%2Ftracks%2F2010%2Fgarment.mp3' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='menu' value='false' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /></object></p></span></p>
<p><em>For 2</em> confirms that Nicolai’s music has become more and more orchestral in recent years, for lack of a better word, and not as heavily anchored in the glitchy beats of <em>Transform</em> and the <em>Transall</em> series. Although the micro beats, squelches and static continue to be among the defining characters of Noto’s music, there’s more going on all around them than there used to be. Of course, Nicolai has been rubbing up against modern classical music in his collaborations with Ryuichi Sakamoto going back as far as 2002 so this is no sudden revelation. But it feels like there’s more weight to his recent solo output as well. His two <em>Xerrox</em> volumes are a case in point.</p>
<p>So is opening track &#8220;<em>Garment (for a garment)</em>&#8220;. The sonic identity is intimately familiar &#8211; sonar beeps, white noise and minimal glitch. But halfway through, the cellos enter, providing the emotional depth that has often been absent from Nicolai&#8217;s sterile soundscapes. It&#8217;s a terrific track and simply put, the blend of the electric and organic just sounds great.</p>
<p>Understandably, since For 2 is a compilation of material composed for many different occasions, there&#8217;s a lot of variety on offer. There&#8217;s the field recording-based &#8220;<em>Villa Aurora (for Marta Feuchtwanger)</em>&#8220;, with birdsong and airplanes flying overhead. The dark and oppressive &#8220;<em>Stalker (for Andrei Tarkovsky)</em>&#8221; features Russian dialogue, presumably from the film of the same name, and is reminiscent of <strong>Kreng&#8217;s</strong> <em>L’Autopsie Phénoménale De Dieu</em>. On the other end of the spectum, there&#8217;s the bright and luminescent &#8220;<em>Sonolumi (for Camera Lucida)</em>&#8221; and the rhythmic beeps of &#8220;<em>T3 (for Dieter Rams)</em>&#8220;. But on the whole, the tone of <em>For 2</em> is contemplative and atmospheric.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:left;display:block;'><p><object type='application/x-shockwave-flash' data='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' width='500' height='24' id='audioplayer1'><param name='movie' value='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' /><param name='FlashVars' value='&amp;bg=0xf8f8f8&amp;leftbg=0xeeeeee&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xcccccc&amp;rightbghover=0x999999&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0x9FFFB8&amp;titles=Stalker%20%28For%20Andrei%20Tarkovsky%29&amp;artists=Alva%20Noto&amp;width=500&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fheadphonecommute.com%2Ftracks%2F2010%2Fstalker.mp3' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='menu' value='false' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /></object></p></span></p>
<p>This is a fascinating and rewarding collection and it makes you want to dive in and explore the connection with the people to whom the music is dedicated. I must admit that most of the names are unfamiliar to me, although I know Russian filmmaker <strong>Andrei Tarkovsky</strong> and have heard of <strong>Phil Niblock</strong>. But the others drew a blank. So I thought it would be worthwhile to flesh out the context a bit. As Carsten Nicolai said when I interviewed him last your for Headphone Commute (see <a href="http://reviews.headphonecommute.com/2009/09/08/two-and-a-half-questions-with-carsten-nicolai/"><strong>Two and a Half Questions with Carsten Nicolai</strong></a>):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I think, personally, that it’s not really necessary for the listener to know the full background of the concept&#8230; The listener can just enjoy and listen without any preconception&#8230; If you want to know more, if you want to have a really detailed view, you can go deeper and you can explore several levels of the piece. It can be enjoyable to be able to see the background of the piece&#8230;&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So while it&#8217;s certainly not essential to know the stories to enjoy the music, it does add an extra dimension. And those familiar with Carsten Nicolai&#8217;s music know that &#8220;concept&#8221; is virtually his middle name. I have therefore added some info on the devotees here below, which may be of interest to those wishing to &#8220;go deeper&#8221;. It&#8217;s well worth the journey.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Villa Aurora (for Marta  Feuchtwanger)</span>: Villa Aurora in Los Angeles is the former home of  German-Jewish writer Lion Feuchtwanger and his wife Marta, and is now  an artists residence used to promote German-American cultural  exchange. Lion Feuchtwanger was on a lecture tour in the U.S. when the  Nazis came to power in Germany and he remained in exile and became a  fierce critic of the Nazis. He and Marta were interned for a time in a  camp in France, where Marta fought for better conditions for the  prisoners. Marta managed to get out and have her husband freed. She then  organized their flight across the Pyrenees to the U.S. Marta lived in  California until her death in 1987.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stalker (for Andrei  Tarkovsky)</span>: <em>Stalker</em> is a 1979 science fiction film by  Andrei Tarkovsky, the most famous Soviet filmmaker since Sergei M.  Eisenstein, according to imdb.com. &#8220;His films are characterized by  spirituality and metaphysical themes, extremely long takes, lack of  conventional dramatic structure and plot, and memorable  cinematography. Ingmar Bergman said of him: &#8216;Tarkovsky for me is the  greatest [director], the one who invented a new language, true to the  nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream&#8217;.&#8221;  [Wikipedia]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sonolumi (for Camera  Lucida)</span>: This piece was recorded for Evelina Domnitch (Belarus)  and Dmitry Gelfand’s (Russia) Camera Lucida project, which centers on  the phenomena of sonoluminescence. Sonoluminescence means to transform  high frequency sound waves into emissions of light irradiated in a gas  infused liquid. (A camera lucida is an optical device used as a drawing  aid by artists; it superimposes the subject onto the surface upon which  the artist is drawing.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Interim and T3 (for Dieter  Rams)</span>: Rams is a German industrial designer closely associated  with the consumer products company Braun and the Functionalist school of  industrial design. He&#8217;s often referred to as &#8220;the designer&#8217;s designer&#8221;.  These two tracks were composed for a ceremony where Rams was presented  with the German Design Award. T3 is a 1958 pocket transistor radio  designed by Rams, which featured a jog-wheel to change channels,  remarkably similar to the design of the iPod.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Early Winter (for Phill  Niblock)</span>: Niblock is a composer,  filmmaker,  videographer, and  director of Experimental Intermedia, a foundation for avant-garde music  based in New York which also has a branch in Ghent, Belgium. &#8220;Early  Winter&#8221; contains a sample from Phill Niblock&#8217;s music; I would assume  that it must be taken from the piece of the same name that appeared on  the 1993 album <em>Music by Phill Niblock</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anthem Berlin (for the  Kingdom of Elgalend-Vargaland)</span>: In 1992, Swedish conceptual  artists and composers Carl Michael von Hausswolf and Leif Elggren&#8217;s  proflaimed the fictional Kingdom of <a href="http://www.elgaland-vargaland.org/" target="_blank">Elgaland-Vargaland</a>,  &#8220;the largest – and most populous realm on Earth, incorporating all  boundaries between other nations as well as Digital Territory and other  states of existence. Every time you travel somewhere, and every time you  enter another form, such as the dream state, you visit  Elgaland-Vargaland.&#8221; Alva Noto&#8217;s national anthem for the Kingdom  premiered at Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin in October 2006.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ans (for Eugeny Murzin)</span>: Murzin  (1914-1970) was a Russian audio engineer who invented the ANS  synthesizer in the late 1950s. ANS was based on the technology  of photo-optic sound recording, which made it possible to obtain a  visible image of a sound wave, as well as to realize the opposite goal  of synthesizing a sound from an artificially drawn sound wave.  Incidentally, most of the music for Andrei Tarkovsky&#8217;s film &#8216;Solaris&#8217;  was made with with the ANS. This interrelationship between audio and the  visual image has been a central aspect of Carsten Nicolai&#8217;s (aka Alva  Noto) work as a visual artist. For &#8220;Ans&#8221;, Noto drew onto the glass plate  of the ANS synthesizer, producing the modulating sound heard on the  composition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Argonaut (for Heiner Müller)</span>: Müller (1929–1995)  was a German (former East German) dramatist, poet, writer, essayist and  theatre director. Described as &#8220;the theatre&#8217;s greatest living poet&#8221;  since Samuel Beckett, Müller has been called the most important German  dramatist of the 20th century after Bertolt Brecht. &#8220;His &#8216;enigmatic,  fragmentary pieces&#8217; are a significant contribution to postmodern drama  andpostdramatic theatre.&#8221; [Wikipedia]</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s nothing more dissatisfying than paying taxes. Seriously. I can&#8217;t think of anything so &#8220;unfair&#8221; and don&#8217;t know a single person who enjoys the process. Although using modern technology to prepare and file is convenient, it&#8217;s still something I never look forward to. It&#8217;s no wonder that everyone in America procrastinates to report the yearly income tax until the very last moment. </p>
<p>Well, at least I&#8217;m done. A few angry hours of watching the numbers run up in the red, one click submit, and it&#8217;s over. Now it&#8217;s time to take out my frustrations on something. What will it be? How about this pile of envelopes in which all of the tax information arrived? Perhaps one of you can use this sample of my shredder to make a dark and angry track. I would be honored. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I began thinking about this project, it was only a matter of time until I captured one of the most famous field recordings &#8211; rain. Of course, the weather is out of my control, and so this event is here now, all on its own. I&#8217;m sure there will be plenty more, but I wanted to make this one a bit unique. And so I set off towards this audio hunt.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 7am in the morning, and on my [headphone] commute to work, I try to find a spot where I can spend a minute recording. I need to be away from loud gusts of winds. And I would like to stay dry during the process. I settle on a semi-empty two level open garage, where the acoustics of the cement walls could compliment the sound. In the back alley, where the entrance opens up towards the falling water, I begin my session. </p>
<p>The rain is falling all around, but the loudest drops land on a plastic covering of a huge metal container, empty of yesterday&#8217;s garbage. In the background a police siren wails. At first, I am a bit annoyed at it &#8211; it is intruding on the sound of the rain. But then I let it all wash over me &#8211; the rain, the siren, the cars squeezing the water between their rubber tires and the asphalt, the subdued deep rumbling of the engines. It is all there. Happening as is. The only way that it could have ever been. And so it is captured. Rain.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4387" title="Monochromes" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/monochromes.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Monochromes Vol. 1</em> is the first volume of archival installations by the Italian multimedia duo, Rossano Polidoro and Emiliano Romanelli, performing under the moniker <strong>TU M</strong>&#8216;. The name, taken from <strong>Marcel Duchamp</strong>&#8217;s same titled painting,  is a French expression in which the verb is missing (tu m’…). This literally translates to &#8220;you [...] me&#8221;, where the missing verb must be provided by the viewer (of the painting), or, in this case, the listener.</p>

<p>The album, released on <strong>Richard Chartier&#8217;s </strong>LINE Records, features the first four (out of nine) audio compositions, created for &#8220;<em>two laptops, two mixing boards, two loudspeakers, one video projector, [and] one room.</em>&#8220; These pieces were recorded live at Vico Santa Chiara Studio, Città Sant’Angelo, Italy in the summer of 2008. For the installation, the duo create an atmosphere where &#8220;<em>sound and light vibrations reverberate inside the room, blending together in an enveloping monochrome, that creates an atmosphere to be contemplated.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>The visuals, available as <a href="http://www.tu-m.com/monochromes/index.html">excerpts</a> on the TU M&#8217;s website, are composed of drawn out monochrome landscapes, resembling distant mountain silhouettes and sluggish geometric figures, visible in change and movement only through sporadic skipping through the captures. Attempting careful observation, or trying to make out patterns that are not there, is futile. It&#8217;s like watching yourself age in the mirror. It&#8217;s like watching the clouds&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
TU M&#8217; &#8211; Monochrome 06+V05 (20 second video excerpt)<br />
<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="http://reviews.headphonecommute.com/2010/03/30/tu-m%e2%80%99-monochromes-vol-1-line/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/bvFmoSEBo18/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The audio compositions paint the same picture. Over a slight white noise hiss and endless loops, the melody swells in ambient waves of sound, sparkling in the light of distant piano notes. Like the waves of an ocean that have been crashing against this beach for thousands of years, and many years to come, this music is new and ancient &#8211; it exists _all_ the time, somewhere completely on its own, only to be summoned into this moment with the press of a button. The sounds fade in and out with the rhythm of my breathing. Inhale soft pads. Exhale minor chords. Let this pattern wash away all worries. And when the [almost] 30 minute track ends, the melody is still there, in the background of my mind.</p>
<p>To round off this exploration of space, sound, and light, intertwined together to create this minimal composition, the duo includes a quote by <strong>Jean Cocteau</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A poet always has too many words in his vocabulary,<br />
a painter too many colors on his palette,<br />
a musician too many notes on his keyboard.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Check out previous numerous releases by TU M&#8217; by rummaging through their sound and visual works, carefully catalogued on their website. Their project under the name of <strong>Steno</strong>, for example, describing themselves as &#8220;<em>a world made up of second-hand music</em>&#8220;, is released on their own, <strong>Mr. Mutt</strong> label, which, not coincidentally, is the name Marcel Duchamp signed on the upside down urinal, and named his found art as <em>Fountain</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4646" title="TU M'" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/tu-m.jpg?w=500&#038;h=250" alt="" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><em><strong>First of all, I have to ask about your moniker, TU M&#8217;, which is named after a Duchamp&#8217;s painting. What is the association, if not fascination, with Marcel Duchamp?</strong></em><br />
Tu m&#8217; is a painting whose complexity and mystery has always fascinated us. In 1998 we were struck by that grouping of real and symbolic elements, the idea of the realization “of a painting of cast shadows”, in an ambiguity of shapes and contents. Like that apostrophe in the end of the name, for example, which was put there to indicate an incompleteness which only the spectator/listener can fill up. A silent collaboration between author and spectator where, in the best of cases, the roles are swapped.</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe the process of the live audio performance and its connection to the video. What software/hardware do you use to sync up the two?</strong></em><br />
We are not interested in the synchronization of two or more types of media, for example, an immediate reaction between cause and effect; but, rather, the juxtapositions of two elements and their possible resonances. In TU M&#8217; we have this idea of the duo/double which has accompanied us for years: the two identities, the two laptops, the horizon line, the analogue and the digital, audio and video etc. Elements that when brought together, project a third shape, a vibrant shadow.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there an audience present in the room during the performance, and how much of their participation affects the outcome?</strong></em><br />
No, there is no audience during our studio performances; the room must be a place of silence and absence. However, right when you press REC on the recorder, you are connected with a possible audience that, sooner or later, will listen to your work, and therefore you have to be very clear about what you would like to express. We are intrigued by the idea of creating music for a single listener, and also how he/she relates to it in the various daily contexts. We are interested in the intimacy between the piece of music and the spectator, in the same way a painting is approached to in a museum, or when the work is left alone to be later found again, we do not believe much in a collective fruition.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is the modular source of the generated audio? Are there any field recordings?</strong></em><br />
In 2006, after the last recording session of &#8220;Fragile Touch Of The Coincidence&#8221;, we realized that we were increasingly using less instruments to compose. We gradually went on from the composition of 24 channel multitrack to the live stereo recording of laptop improvisations. We removed every external sound source, like acoustic instruments, field recordings, etc. and we decided to use only loops generated synthetically by laptop/Reaktor, reprocessing them live through a digital/analogue feedback. Thus, we decided to rid ourselves of all that unused instrumentation, to remain with only: 2 laptops, 2 mixing-boards, 2 headphones, some cables and a 2-channel recorder; the basis for the future project &#8220;Monochromes&#8221;. Currently, accompanied also by a setting of the 2002 Reaktor, our instrumentation has remained almost unvaried. We see the laptop and the mixing-board as veritable contemporary musical instruments with their own voice; a metaphor of the double, of the digital and of the analogue, in the search of a coexistence, or maybe of an exchange of identities.</p>
<p><em><strong>Can you elaborate on the quote from Jean Cocteau? Are you purposefully limiting yourself to the quantity of material in music and video?</strong></em><br />
In 2006, we started to delve deeper into the study of ars antiqua, of chamber music, of landscape painting, and of the softsynth; trying to investigate the possible limits of the duo, of the instrumentation, of composition. While rereading some notes, the following quote emerged: <em>&#8220;A poet always has too many words in his vocabulary,  a painter too many colors on his palette,  a musician too many notes on his keyboard.&#8221; </em>Not by coincidence, from &#8220;Le Coq et l&#8217;Arlequin&#8221; by Cocteau; right in our most subtraction period. A 1918 sentence, written subsequent to San Francesco d&#8217;Assisi but before Donald Judd and which revealed a current state and a possible direction towards a greater awareness in making decisions. Giving a greater importance to the action of choosing.</p>
<p><em><strong>When is the second volume out? And are there any plans on releasing Monochromes on Video?</strong></em><br />
We decided to work calmly and to record the new compositions only in four sessions during the year. The silence and the time between a session and another are as much important as the composition itself. We think that &#8220;Monochromes Vol.1&#8243; still has much to say, even in the coming years.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s 5:30 on a Monday evening, and I shuffle into the elevator on my way home from work. There&#8217;s nothing exciting about this one minute descend, yet it is a prelude to my daily commute, which the brain tends to simply filter out. Here it is captured, in all of its mundane glory.</p>

<p>Listening closely a few more times, I like how the space of the elevator &#8220;room&#8221; gets tighter, once the doors close&#8230; At the end of the recording, a guy swipes his pass-card, opens the door and says &#8220;go ahead&#8221;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4576" title="Later" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/later.jpg?w=500&#038;h=250" alt="" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p>This week we bring you a wonderful selection of modern classical and experimental pieces as compiled by <strong>Cole Pierce</strong>. <em>Later</em> was originally produced in a unique edition of 60 CDs, featuring a poem by Tyler Carter and packaged with the playlist printed on found paper and were distributed to Cole Pierce&#8217;s mix CD mailing list in January of 2010. The ongoing multiples project (since 2004) consists of mixed CDs produced and mailed about twice a year. Cole Pierce is a Chicago based artist making paintings and video installations, holds an MFA in Art Theory &amp; Practice from Northwestern (2007). Check out his work and download more of his mixes at <a href="http://colepierce.com">colepierce.com</a> and also at his blog &#8211; <a href="http://prestosamo.blogspot.com">prestosamo.blogspot.com</a><br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Here&#8217;s Cole Pierce, with his reflections on the mix:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Last summer I found four tracks that embodied everything I love about ambient music. I listened to this short 17 minute set repeatedly; Machinefabriek&#8217;s guitar over a field recording of ice skaters on a frozen pond, The Humble Bee&#8217;s pleasant tones and Greg Haines&#8217; minimal orchestra that shifts to drones, eventually breaking to pieces before transitioning to the casual, incidental tones layered over the sounds of a coffee shop created by Molly Berg + Stephen Vitiello. This set of glitchy ambient music served as the impetus for the track selection and frame of the overall structure. The basic ingredients for the whole mix can be found in the subtleties mentioned in this short set in the middle of Later; which is a genre study in music emphasizing modern classical harmonies and a balance between experimental production techniques. That said, I believe a good mix is one of thoughtful variety and the rest of the tracks transition through multiple genres that can all be described as ambient. Regardless of the instruments used, the pace is gentle, repetitive, even tempered and anticlimactic. Post-rock, modern classical, sublime electronic, field recordings, and spoken word pieces are patched together to provide interesting comparisons and juxtapositions. Nils Frahm plays piano and Mokira plays electronics, yet both are inspired by a Phillip Glass type of sublime meditation. These two tracks are connected by an equally meditative interlude which is a field recording of someone talking to himself during a night hike, calmly identifying his surroundings and admiring the amount of visible stars.</em></p></blockquote>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<em>While this podcast is one continuous track, I usually organize my mixes into 3 or 4 sets.  I do this so the listener can enter the mix at different points, and provide an option other than the usual linear one hour &#8211; beginning to end &#8211; mixed CD. It is a personal preference of mine, because I end up inadvertently ignoring the last half of too many mixes and podcasts.  </em><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by <strong>Taylor Deupree&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.12k.com/onesoundeachday/"><em>One Sound Each Day</em></a> project, I set off on my own journey of aural documentation of my life. Except, there are no rules for this one. No scheduled daily search of sound, and no particular beginning or end. These are just my <strong>Sound Postcards</strong>&#8230; From me to you&#8230;</p>
<p>With no specific place to start, I felt that it was rather appropriate to sit down at my baby grand, and play you a spontaneous one minute piece. With no preparation or any melody in mind, I let the sound travel through my fingers, into the keys, the hammers, the strings, and the mic. That is the only way this chapter may begin. So let it be. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Sorry for the low background hum &#8211; must be coming from my central heating unit, since I placed my M-Audio Microtrack directly on the piano. You can also hear the pedal lifting all the hammers off the strings. That part is rather nice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-4543" href="http://reviews.headphonecommute.com/2010/03/27/cell-hanging-masses-ultimae/hanging-masses/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4543" title="Hanging Masses" src="http://headphonecommute.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/hanging-masses.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Frenchman Alex Scheffer, aka <strong>Cell</strong>, is an <strong>Ultimae</strong> regular, having contributed tracks to many of the label&#8217;s compilation albums, including the excellent <em>Fahrenheit</em> series. Yet, <em>Hanging Masses</em> is his first album for the label and only his second overall, not counting a couple of notable live releases. I&#8217;ve always honed in on Cell&#8217;s tracks; he usually manages to hit a really sweet spot, mixing a deep slowly developing ambient/downtempo vibe with catchy hooks and wet, shimmering synths on top.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:left;display:block;'><p><object type='application/x-shockwave-flash' data='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' width='500' height='24' id='audioplayer1'><param name='movie' value='http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' /><param name='FlashVars' value='&amp;bg=0xf8f8f8&amp;leftbg=0xeeeeee&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xcccccc&amp;rightbghover=0x999999&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0x9FFFB8&amp;titles=Calling&amp;artists=Cell&amp;width=500&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fheadphonecommute.com%2Ftracks%2F2010%2Fcalling.mp3' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='menu' value='false' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /></object></p></span></p>
<p>Yet, his prior full-length, <em>Phonic Peace</em>, released by <strong>Indica</strong> in 2005, was not my cup of tea. Too much of the sort of pseudo Indian mysticism that just rubs me the wrong way. Like a lot of other people, I was energized by the music coming out of Britain&#8217;s Asian underground scene in the mid to late &#8217;90s &#8211; Talvin&#8217;s Singh&#8217;s Anokha album in &#8216;97, State of Bengal, Joi, Cornershop and the like. But for some reason I then developed a real aversion to the fusion of traditional Indian and electronic music. Don&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Hanging Masses</em> is more in line with his live releases &#8211; <em>Live at Glade Festival 2005</em> (<strong>Sofa Manifesto</strong>, 2007) and <em>Live at Kumharas &#8211; Ibiza</em> (<strong>Ultimae</strong>, 2007) &#8211; only even more mellow and low key. According to Ultimae&#8217;s press release, the album &#8220;<em>constitutes in the artist&#8217;s heart a homage to Brian Eno, Tangerine Dream and Steve Reich.</em>&#8221; The connection with Reich is not obvious but Eno and TD are definitely in attendance.</p>
<p>Cell is not a man in a hurry. He&#8217;s content to slowly fill in the sonic landscape, sprinkling it with gently euphoric glimpses of light. Even when the 4/4 kick drum makes an appearance, typically about half way through a song, the pace never exceeds a leisurely stroll. The experience is akin to lying in a field, gazing at the cloud formations for hours and then suddenly deciding to get up to take a walk through the enchanted forest nearby. The restrained but propulsive groove, such as on the mesmerizing title track, ensures that it&#8217;s a captivating experience.</p>
<p>Recommended for all followers of Ultimae&#8217;s roster, including <strong>Aes Dana, H.U.V.A. Network, Solar Fields,</strong> and <strong>Hol Baumann</strong>. Also, be sure to stop by at Cell&#8217;s page at <a href="http://www.kahvi.org/artists2.php?artist=Cell"><b>Kahvi Collective</b></a>, where he released a five track EP completely for FREE, featuring sampler tracks from his various releases!</p>
